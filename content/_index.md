A2Go provides forum for people working in or around Ann Arbor with the Go programming language to discuss ideas, issues and share solutions.  A2Go
will hold their first Meetup on Tuesday, Sept 10, 2019.

We seek to enable minorities in tech to use Go as a tool to learn and teach programming, and, ultimately, to empower underrepresented groups in tech to help increase diversity in the Go community.

The Ann Arbor Go Programming Language Meetup is more commonly known as **A2Go**. A2Go typically hold a Meetup once a month at a
variety of venues across the city. All Meetups are free, and typically comprise a number of talks and socializing, with
food and drink provided.

Membership of A2Go is managed via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/A2Go-Golang-developer-meetup/); everyone is
welcome!

Submit a talk proposal, or come join us in the
`#a2go` channel in the [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com) ([sign-up here](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)).
